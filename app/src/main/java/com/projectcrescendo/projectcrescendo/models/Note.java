/**
 * The note class is a class to model a musical note. It contains all the data about the note -
 * and the data held by this class can be changed by the user in the app.
 * <p>
 * Pitch of the note in the form A0, F4 etc...
 * Could be represented as int (only three option) or enum?
 * How loud the note is (again could be enum or int)
 * Accent, Staccato or not (again could enum or int);
 * How long the note should last (relative to the bar?) - (1.0 = a bar)
 * Pitch should be passed in constructor, if no dynamic is given one should be assumed (mf).
 * <p>
 * Originally created by Charlie Marcus, added to the app by Dylan McKee on 16/11/15.
